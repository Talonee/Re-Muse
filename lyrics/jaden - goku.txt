Oh! I feel like I'm-
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Goku

Ayy, borracho, borracho, borracho
I'm supersonic with the vinyls
Ayy, tectonic volcano in a island you don't want no problems (Blow up)
All you jokers need to grow up
You ain't know it then, now you know it
Ayy, my credit card didn't go through
I'm ballin' I feel like I'm Goku


Ayy, ayy, yeah, come again
Ayy, yeah, uh I feel like I'm Goku
Look at 'em
Yeah, come again
Ayy, yeah
Ballin' I feel like I'm Goku
Ayy, my credit card didn't go through
I'm ballin' I feel like I'm Goku
Goku, ballin' I feel like I'm Goku
Ayy, my credit card didn't go through
I'm ballin' I feel like I'm Goku
Ballin' I feel like I'm Goku (Oh!)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ballin' I'm feeling like Goku, Goku, Goku
Uh, feel like I'm - ooh
Ouu ouu, ouu ouu
Ballin' I feel like I'm Goku, Goku, Goku

She just want happy, happy, happy, happy endings
Girl just stop pretending and that's new beginnings
MSFTS music with a new lieutenant, way too moist
Just hit you with that stupid vision
Man, I'm balling jokers and my soup is finished
'Bout to sip it, sip it, sip it, syrup, ooh
Need to quit the sipping syrup, 'fore you in the dirt
Remember that's why they said they for Yams
With my homies in the Jeep
Bumpin' Lord Pretty Flacko with the prayer hands
I said it once and I'm gon' say again
You rollercoastin' in Vegas man
I'm the closest to the greatest
That statement is daily debated
I'm slaughterhousin' on the pavement
Tell Charlamagne that we just made it
You can't even catch on my cadence
Just 'cause you lazy and faded
You washed up and wanna be famous
All the misfits, they been waiting
I'm 'bout to play this on the stages
I'm 'bout to see them in amazement
All my verses been in cages
'Bout to let 'em loose and show the world where music ranges
Put they album on the pavement
Spit the fire 'til they cave in
Teo told me I should say

Borracho, borracho, borracho
I'm supersonic with the vinyls
Ayy, tectonic volcano in a island you don't want no problems
(Blow up)
All you jokers need to grow up
You ain't know it then, now you know it
Ayy, my credit card didn't go through
I'm ballin' I feel like I'm Goku

Ayy, ayy, yeah, come again
Ayy, yeah, uh
I feel like I'm Goku
Look at 'em
Yeah, come again
Ayy, yeah, ballin' I feel like I'm Goku
Ayy, my credit card didn't go through
I'm ballin' I feel like I'm Goku
Goku, ballin' I feel like I'm Goku
Ay, my credit card didn't go through
I'm ballin' I feel like I'm Goku
Ballin' I feel like I'm Goku (Ooh!)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ballin' I'm feeling like Goku, Goku, Goku
Uh, feel like I'm - ooh
Ouu ouu, ouu ouu
Ballin' I feel like I'm Goku, Goku, Goku

Ayy, ayy, yeah, come again
Ayy, yeah, uh
Feel like I'm Goku
Ooh, look at 'em
Yeah, come again
Ayy, yeah
Ballin' I feel like I'm Goku
Ayy, ayy, yeah, come again
Ayy, yeah, uh
Feel like I'm Goku

Yeah, come again
Ayy, yeah
Ballin' I feel like I'm Goku
